\chapter{Technical Basics}

Parcel to use Node.js and pack dependencies (\url{https://parceljs.org/}). Compare to Webpack etc.?

To work with Set (also Stack and Range) in JS (\url{https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/}), because native Set is comparing by object by Object reference (\url{http://2ality.com/2015/01/es6-maps-sets.html#why-cant-i-configure-how-maps-and-sets-compare-keys-and-values}).

Two.js to animate and use svg files (\url{https://two.js.org/}). Maybe compare to other Libraries?

Seedrandom to replicate previous calculations (\url{https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom})

Promises in JS (\url{https://medium.freecodecamp.org/promises-in-javascript-explained-277b98850de})

Multi Threading in JS (\url{https://medium.com/techtrument/multithreading-javascript-46156179cf9a} \& \url{https://www.html5rocks.com/de/tutorials/workers/basics/})

(Not in use yet) Combination of those two (\url{https://github.com/nolanlawson/promise-worker})
